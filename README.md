# Movie Center

This is a movie viewing/tracking application made with Flutter. For the backend, i used Cloud Firestore and i populated Firestore with the information that i have received from IMDB page. For bottom navigation bar, i used curved_navigation_bar package and for extending description of the movie, i used readmore package. State management is done by provider package and other styling is done by me.
